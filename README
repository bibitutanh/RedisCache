A CakePHP 2.0 plugin enabling Redis (http://redis.io/) backed sessions and caching. Uses the Predis (https://github.com/nrk/predis) library to communicate with Redis. Version 0.7 is included.

## Initial setup required

The plugin includes its own bootstrap.php file which must be loaded in the application bootstrap.php file like so:
CakePlugin::load(array('RedisCache' => array('bootstrap' => true)));

The plugin will, by default, communicate with a Redis server setup on localhost at port 6379 with no password. However
you may use remote Redis servers if desired. You can also configure different servers for caching and session duties
as the exact configuration of these may be slightly different for best performance.

## Using for Session handling:

In app/Config/core.php under the session configuration section:

Configure::write('Session', array(
        'cookie' => {{YOUR COOKIE NAME HERE}}
        , 'timeout' => 60
        , 'handler' => array(
            'engine' => 'RedisCache.RedisSession'
        )
	));


## Using for Caching (e.g. for model data):

In app/Config/bootstrap.php

Cache::config({{ YOUR UNIQUE CACHE NAME HERE }}, array('engine' => 'RedisCache.Redis'));
